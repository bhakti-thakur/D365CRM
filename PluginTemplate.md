# üìò CRM Plugin Template with Explanation

---

## üîß Namespace and Usings

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
```

```csharp
using Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk;
using System.ServiceModel;
```

These are necessary for accessing CRM interfaces like `IPlugin`, `IOrganizationService`, and handling faults from the CRM web service.

```csharp
public class ClassName : IPlugin
```
This declares the plugin class. All plugins must implement `IPlugin` to be recognized and executed by CRM.

```csharp
public ClassName() { }
```
Default constructor: Can be used to initialize configuration or dependencies if needed. Optional if no setup required.

```csharp
public void Execute(IServiceProvider serviceProvider)
```
This is the main method called by CRM when the plugin is triggered.

```csharp
IPluginExecutionContext context = (IPluginExecutionContext)
  serviceProvider.GetService(typeof(IPluginExecutionContext));
```
Provides runtime information: entity involved, message name (e.g., Create), user info, stage (Pre/Post), Input/Output parameters, etc.
## What is IPluginExecutionContext?
IPluginExecutionContext is the core context object passed into your plugin during runtime.
It gives you everything you need to know about the event that triggered the plugin ‚Äî like:

- Who triggered it?

- What record(s) were involved?

- Which message (e.g., Create, Update)?

- What stage is the plugin running in?

## Why is it important?
You cannot write meaningful plugin logic without this context ‚Äî it contains the real-time environment your plugin is running in.

## How It Fits in the Plugin Lifecycle
User Action (e.g., Update Contact) 
    ‚û°Ô∏è
CRM triggers pipeline 
    ‚û°Ô∏è
Plugin fires 
    ‚û°Ô∏è
CRM injects IPluginExecutionContext ‚ûù you use it to make your logic dynamic


```csharp
IOrganizationServiceFactory serviceFactory = 
  (IOrganizationServiceFactory)serviceProvider.GetService(typeof(IOrganizationServiceFactory));
```
- This line fetches a factory from the CRM pipeline's service provider.

- A factory is a design pattern that helps you generate instances of a service (here, `IOrganizationService`).

- This is needed because plugin code does not run in your user‚Äôs session directly, so you need this service to connect to Dataverse programmatically.

```csharp
IOrganizationService orgService = 
  serviceFactory.CreateOrganizationService(context.UserId);
```
- Now that we have a factory, this line creates a service instance (object) using the factory.

- It passes `context.UserId` ‚Äî meaning the plugin will execute as the user who triggered the plugin.

- You can use `orgService` to:

    - `Create`, `Retrieve`, `Update`, `Delete` records

    - Run FetchXML queries

    - Execute custom actions or workflows

 Required to perform CRUD operations. `CreateOrganizationService(context.UserId)` ensures the plugin runs with the current user's privileges.

 ## Why This Separation Exists?
- `IPluginExecutionContext`: Tells you what happened.

- `IOrganizationService`: Lets you do something in Dataverse.

- `IOrganizationServiceFactory`: Bridges them by creating the service dynamically.

 ```csharp
 ITracingService tracingService = 
  (ITracingService)serviceProvider.GetService(typeof(ITracingService));
```
Useful for logging debug messages and troubleshooting, especially in sandbox environments where normal debugging isn't possible.

```csharp
if (context.InputParameters.Contains("Target") && 
    context.InputParameters["Target"] is Entity)
{
    Entity table_name = (Entity)context.InputParameters["Target"];
```
Checks if the plugin was triggered by a record-level event and safely extracts the target entity object.

```csharp
    if (table_name.LogicalName == "table_name")
    {
        // Your plugin logic here
    }
}
```
Verifies the entity is the expected table (e.g., account, contact). Helps avoid running logic on the wrong entity.

```csharp
catch (FaultException<OrganizationServiceFault> ex)
{
    throw new InvalidPluginExecutionException("The following error occurred in MyPlugin.", ex);
}
```
Catches CRM-specific service faults and throws them wrapped in a plugin-safe exception.
```csharp
catch (Exception ex)
{
    tracingService.Trace("ClassName: error: {0}", ex.ToString());
    throw;
}
```
Logs unexpected errors and rethrows them. Always use tracing to log errors in plugins.
